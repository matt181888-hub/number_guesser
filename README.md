# number-guesser
First project, number guessing game with difficulty levels. 

How to Play

1. Run the game in your terminal or Python environment.
2. Choose a difficulty level:
   - **Easy** (`e`) – 15 guesses
   - **Medium** (`m`) – 8 guesses
   - **Hard** (`h`) – 4 guesses
3. Try to guess the number between 1 and 100.
4. After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
   - "That number is high, try again."
   - "That's low, try again."
   - "Congratulations!" if you guess correctly.
5. If you run out of guesses, the game ends.
6. You’ll be asked if you want to play again and can choose a new difficulty.
